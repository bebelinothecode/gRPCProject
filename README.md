# gRPCProject
gRPC is a cross-platform RPC(Remote Procedure Call) framework created by Google.
It is used for connecting services in a microservices architecture. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the
interface description language. It provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking and non-blocking bindings
cancellation and timeouts.

This project is a simple implementaion of gRPC in Javascript(Nodejs). I hope this helps you.
